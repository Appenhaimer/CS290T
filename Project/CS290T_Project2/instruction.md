# Project Instructions for Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

This document contains instructions for implementing three reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, PPO, and DDPG) on specific environments using provided neural network structures. Each task is detailed below with environment descriptions, objectives, and algorithm pseudocode where applicable. Complete the implementations in the specified `.ipynb` files without modifying the provided neural network structures.

## Task 1: Deep Q-Network (DQN) on Taxi Environment

### Environment Description
- **Name**: Taxi (from Gymnasium's toy_text environments)
- **Details**: 
  - Grid: $5 \times 5$
  - Objective: Move a taxi to pick up a passenger at one of four designated locations (Red, Green, Yellow, Blue), then drop them off at their destination.
  - State: Taxi starts at a random square; passenger starts at a designated location.
  - Episode End: When the passenger is dropped off.
  - Rewards:
    - +20 for successful drop-off
    - -10 for illegal pickup/drop-off actions
    - -1 per step

### Problem Context
- The state space is large (hundreds of states), making traditional Q-learning memory-intensive.
- Use DQN to approximate the Q-value function with a parameterized neural network, suitable for discrete action spaces.

### Task
- **File**: `dqn.ipynb`
- **Objective**: Implement the DQN algorithm to solve the Taxi environment.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use the provided deep neural network structure and `ReplayBuffer` without modification.
  - Implement the basic update iteration process.
  - Update the target network after a specified number of steps.

## Task 2: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO-Clip) on Breakout Environment

### Environment Description
- **Name**: Breakout (from Arcade Learning Environment via Gym API)
- **Details**:
  - Framework: Atari 2600 game via ALE (built on Stella emulator).
  - Objective: Move a paddle to hit a ball and destroy a brick wall at the top of the screen.
  - Dynamics: Score points by breaking bricks; break through the wall to let the ball cause chaos.
  - Lives: 5
- **References**: 
  - [ALE Gymnasium Interface](https://ale.farama.org/gymnasium-interface)
  - [ALE Breakout Documentation](https://ale.farama.org/environments/breakout/)

### Problem Context
- PPO is an Actor-Critic algorithm improving on TRPO by simplifying implementation and enhancing performance.
- Use PPO-Clip variant, which restricts the objective function to limit policy updates for stability.

### Algorithm: PPO-Clip
```
Input: initial policy parameters θ₀, initial value function parameters φ₀
For k = 0, 1, 2, ...:
    Collect trajectories Dₖ = {τᵢ} by running policy πₖ = π(θₖ) in the environment.
    Compute rewards-to-go Rₜ.
    Compute advantage estimates Aᵢ using current value function Vφ₀.
    Update policy by maximizing PPO-Clip objective (via stochastic gradient ascent with Adam).
    Fit value function by regression on mean-squared error (via gradient descent).
End For
```

### Task
- **File**: `ppo.ipynb`
- **Objective**: Implement the PPO-Clip algorithm on the Breakout environment.
- **Requirements**:
  - Use the provided actor and critic neural network structures (shared network) without modification.
  - Implement the basic update iteration process using the PPO-Clip method.

## Task 3: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) on Pendulum Environment

### Environment Description
- **Name**: Pendulum (from Gym’s Classic Control environments)
- **Details**:
  - Objective: Apply torque to swing an inverted pendulum to an upright position.
  - State: x-y coordinates of the free end, angular velocity.
  - Action: Torque applied to the free end.
  - Reward: Non-positive (max 0); higher reward for upright position, low angular velocity, and minimal torque.
- **Reference**: [Gym Pendulum Documentation](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/pendulum/)

### Problem Context
- PPO is on-policy with low sample efficiency; DQN is off-policy but limited to discrete actions.
- DDPG uses a deterministic policy and gradient ascent to handle continuous action spaces.

### Algorithm: DDPG
```
Input: initial policy parameters θ, Q-function parameters φ, empty replay buffer D
Set target parameters: θ_targ ← θ, φ_targ ← φ
Repeat:
    Observe state s, select action a = clip(μθ(s) + ε, a_Low, a_High), where ε ~ N
    Execute a in environment
    Observe next state s′, reward r, done signal d
    Store (s, a, r, s′, d) in replay buffer D
    If s′ is terminal, reset environment
    If time to update:
        For each update:
            Sample batch B = {(s, a, r, s′, d)} from D
            Compute targets: y(r, s′, d) = r + γ(1-d)Qφ_targ(s′, μθ_targ(s′))
            Update Q-function: ∇φ (1/|B|) Σ(Qφ(s, a) - y(r, s′, d))²
            Update policy: ∇θ (1/|B|) Σ Qφ(s, μθ(s))
            Update target networks:
                φ_targ ← ρφ_targ + (1-ρ)φ
                θ_targ ← ρθ_targ + (1-ρ)θ
        End For
    End If
Until convergence
```
